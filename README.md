## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medixmanager.git
    cd medixmanager
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies for Server and Client:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    For Client
    ```
    npm run build
    ```

3. **Set up the database:**

    - Ensure you have MySQL installed and running.
    - Connect to cs340 database:
        ```
        mysql -u [cs340_username] -h classmysql.engr.oregonstate.edu -p
        [cs340_username]
        ```
        
    - Import the SQL schema and sample data:
        ```
        source ddl.sql
        source dml.sql
        ```

4. **Configure the database connection:**
   right now its commented out because I was only working on the front end.

    - Update the `app.js` file with your database credentials:
        ```javascript
        const mysql = require('mysql');

        const connection = mysql.createConnection({
            host: 'localhost',
            user: 'yourusername',
            password: 'yourpassword',
            database: 'medixmanager'
        });

        module.exports = connection;
        ```

5. **Start the application:**
    ```
    bash
    npm start
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use `nodemon` to automatically restart the server when changes are detected:
    ```bash
    npm install -g nodemon
    nodemon app.js
    ```

6. **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://yourserveraddress:3000
    ```

    or use the school server which is:
   ```
   http://flip.engr.oregonstate.edu:3000
   ```
